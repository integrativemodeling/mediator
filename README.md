The 21-subunit Mediator complex transduces regulatory information from
enhancers to promoters, and performs an essential role in the initiation
of transcription in all eukaryotes. In this study we performed chemical
cross-linking and mass spectrometry, and combined the results with information
from X-ray crystallography, homology modeling, and cryo-electron microscopy
by an integrative modeling approach to determine a 3-D model of the entire
Mediator complex. The approach is validated by the use of X-ray crystal
structures as internal controls and by consistency with previous results
from electron microscopy and yeast two-hybrid screens. The model shows the
locations and orientations of all Mediator subunits, as well as subunit
interfaces and some secondary structural elements. Segments of 20-40 amino
acid residues are placed with an average precision of 20 Ã…. The model reveals
roles of individual subunits in the organization of the complex. 

## Compatibility:

The scripts were run for the publication with `IMP.pmi` version from `915c00bac191ab32f022ae425facf538b64e3e54` to `32a774583007c3a7135c8adf970846ea7a52f453` and `IMP` version `3d7d35a367342a94655b5ca2f75cc4d4fb2d5c71`. They should also
work with any recent version of IMP.

## Running the modeling script:

For more details on how to install IMP, run the modeling scripts and analyze
the results using IMP and IMP.pmi see the
[IMP tutorial](https://integrativemodeling.org/nightly/doc/manual/rnapolii_stalk.html).

In brief, to use Replica Exchange, IMP must be compiled using an openmpi c++ compiler. We suggest to compile openmpi with the --disable-dlopen flag. See the [IMP building instructions](https://integrativemodeling.org/nightly/doc/html/installation.html).

To run the modeling script, access the `sampling/modeling` directory
and then run with 64 threads (64 replicas):

    mpirun -np 64 python modeling.py
